# Solarpunk Bibliography

Hello! My name is Chase Tramel, and this is a solarpunk bibliography that I've created to share publicly with anyone who'd like to read on this topic. I'd like to, over time, annotate each of these sources with more information. 

If you have suggestions or new resources you'd like to add, please submit a pull request. (In the case that you aren't familiar with Git and GitHub, email me at [chasetramel@hey.com](mailto:chasetramel@hey.com).) I'd love to include your contributions!

Please also reach out if you'd like to collaborate on this project.
