# Solarpunk Bibliography

Hello! My name is Chase Tramel, and this is a solarpunk bibliography that I've created to share publicly with anyone who'd like to read on this topic. I'd like to, over time, annotate each of these sources with more information. 

This bibliography is licensed under Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal (CC0), so anyone may reference it, reuse it, and remix it under personal or commercial circumstances without attribution. That said, pointing people towards this repo may help bring more people to the resource, so I would appreciate that, but it's not required. 

If you have suggestions or new resources you'd like to add, please submit a pull request. In the case that you aren't familiar with Git and GitHub, email me at [chasetramel@hey.com](mailto:chasetramel@hey.com). I'd love to include your contributions!

Please also reach out if you'd like to collaborate on this project. In order of priority, I'm looking for help: 
- Writing (human-written) annotations for resources, summarizing each and discussing what they might be useful for. I would provide a style guide.
- Confirming that the citations are correct and up-to-date, and correcting them if they are not. Currently, they are loosely MLA 9th edition.
- Making sure all of the URLs are still active and link to the intended resource. This would only need to be done periodically.
- Adding new resources relating to solarpunk, especially filling in gaps I may have missed.
