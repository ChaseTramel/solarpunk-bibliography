# Quick Request for Contributors

Hello, I've created a bibliography of curated solarpunk resources to share information in an accessible way. In many aspects, this is a continuation of [Solarpunk: A Reference Guide](https://medium.com/solarpunks/solarpunk-a-reference-guide-8bcf18871965)

In order of priority, I'm looking for help: 
- Writing (human-written) annotations for resources, summarizing each and discussing what they might be useful for. I would provide a style guide.
- Confirming that the citations are correct and up-to-date, and correcting them if they are not. Currently, they are loosely MLA 9th edition.
- Making sure all of the URLs are still active and link to the intended resource. This would only need to be done periodically.
- Adding new resources relating to solarpunk, especially filling in gaps I may have missed.

Skills with GitHub can be taught! Just looking for passionate people.
